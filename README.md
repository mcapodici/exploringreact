# Exploring React

Small ReactJS projects I am doing for fun. 

You might find them useful, or even be inspired to collaborate.

I use Typescript for my programming (sorry I can't go back to plain JS), but I don't think it makes it that
much harder to read.

## Projects

* [Birthdays](/birthdays): A a simple React App to store people's birthdays.
